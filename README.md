## Hello, My name is Roque Barbosa <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampavangandhi/iampavangandhi/master/gifs/Hi.gif" height="40em">

I'm 24yo from the northeast of Brazil, and I'm a Fullstack Javascript Developer. From the time I was a child I've been interested in technology. My first contact with a computer happened when I was 4 years old - it was my father's 2mb ram machine. Since then I became more and more interested in technology.

In 2018 I joined the Physics Bachelor at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) where my contact with new technologies and science became even more intense and it was at UFRN that I actually started to program. There I was able to learn C++, Python and Fortran. I started to study the area of Quantum Physics called Density Functional Theory (DFT) using ab-initio Crystal17 software for calculations.

Since the beginning of 2021 I have been studying programming in a self-taught way focused on Fullstack Development and Cyber Security.
