## Hi

I first became interested in games, which motivated me to attend a high school that combined traditional studies with a technical education in informatics. From then on, I fell in love with coding and went straight from technical school to a degree in Computer Science.
Today, I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science and have had the opportunity to work in diverse areas — from telecom and observability to web development, and from databases and queries to mobile applications. I’ve worked with a wide range of technologies, including Java, Python, JavaScript, Elixir, PHP, and Ruby — and the list goes on.
